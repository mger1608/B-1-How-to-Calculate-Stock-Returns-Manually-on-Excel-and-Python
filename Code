# Two ways to calculate returns. One is painful, one is easier. We are going to try the painful way first.

# First, create another column for the price at 'price_t-1'
df['price_t-1'] = df['price_t'].shift(1)
df.head()

# Using this approach, when we want to calculate returns using manual approach. Returns is equal to
df['returns_manual'] = (df['price_t']/df['price_t-1']) -1

# Take each value at price 'time_t' and divide by 't-1' then subtract 1
df.head()
df.tail()

# The more fun way to calculate returns is to use the built in 'percent change' method to calculate the percent change in the 'price_t' column
df['return_pct_change_method'] = df['price_t'].pct_change(1)
df.head()

df['returns'] = (df['price_t']/df['price_t-1']) -1
df.head()

# Now that we can calculate returns, let's do something more interesting by plotting the prices. We will first need to set the index for the date columns
df.set_index('date', inplace=True)
df.head()

# Now let's plot the prices
df['price_t'].plot(figsize=(12,8))

# Based on a price graph, it appears that price is predictable, but this is not indicative of the returns associated with the price.
df['returns'].plot(figsize=(12,8))

# Looking at the returns you can see that returns on a day to day basis are completely random, ranging between +15% and -25%. Despite what
# someone might tell you, the returns are difficult to predict on a daily basis. This is true of almost any stock you can think of. This
# is because stocks follow what we call a 'random walk'. It's better to pick stocks based on 'expected returns' rather than 
# 'historical returns' partly because of this truth. 

# There are three main ways to calculate a stock's expected return.
# 1. Using the stock's historic average return
# 2. Using state-contingent weighted probabilities
# 3. Using Asset Pricing Models (CAPM)
